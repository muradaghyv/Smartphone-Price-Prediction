Smartphone Prices Prediction using Random Forest Regressor and K Neighbors Regressor Algorithms. As because these 2 models give the best scores among other models, like XGBoost Regressor, Linear Regression Model, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Algorithms. The process starts witth data cleaning and filling missing values. Then, the main part is coming:Exploratory Data Analysis. In EDA, the relationship between numerical columns and the relationship between numerical columns and price column have been analyzed. Moreover, the relationship between each categorical columns and the relationship between each categorical column and target column have been analyzed. The most important part was creating model for regression. As mentioned above, after trying multiple models, the most optimal models were KNN and Random Forest Regressor models. The accuracy of them are about 76-78% which is fair for regression problems.
